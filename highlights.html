<p> I am in the Junior A basketball team, I happen to also be the captian of the team. Basketball has hasen't always been a passion of mine. But I had started to pick it up when I was in year 8 and joined a club called Young Bucks. Soon I will be able to attend a massive tournment called the Junior Winter Cup.</p>


    
    
    
    
<p>Gaming is something that I enjoy and have fun with, it is a massive hobby for me as I basically play everyday. Whenever I play I train myself to play for tournments. I have played many tournments but 2 of my biggest ones were when I won a Fortnite tournments both making $750.
